# Machine-Learning-Music-Recommendation-System
This is the my Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree capstone project. In this project I have built a music recommendation system that recommendation system that recommends songs for users based on their music taste. The model works by clustering users with similar music taste and selects a random song from the clusters most listened to songs in order to keep users exploring new songs.
